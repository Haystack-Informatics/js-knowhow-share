"...how long does it take to become a JS developer.."
"...how can we learn or go about learning modern JS..."
```
This is a formal response which aims to address those, and related, concerns.

### Preamble
Learning modern JavaScript technologies can be overwhelming. I recall being lost most of the time. There are all these libraries out there, various frameworks, provided in a expansive tool-set to choose from without authoritative instructions! Where am I supposed to start? What does what? How does this library with work this tool? You get the point. 

So I took a serious look back over my indoctrination experience, as well as the time thereafter, and a few key concepts surfaced which I wish I would've known beforehand. Throughout this, I'll denote...

This isn't gospel

I'm not too sure how everyone else prefers to learn so..

Note: Be weary of blogs. The majority of them have been scrapped by some crawler from one another and can be misleading. **If you do stumble upon a post be mindful of the version of the respective technology that is used in said post. The JavaScript world is a developing one. As a language itself as well as the general supporting ecosystem. There can be paradigm-changing differences between major version releases.** In short, I always find it helpful to go to the core tech docs from the distributor of each respective technology. IHMO this saves times and ensures you're consuming valid information.

## Box Config
....download node, [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download)

## Node, NPM, and Local Development

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript **runtime environment** (similar to CLR) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is Node's package manager (similar to NuGet). 

Forewarning, there are [over 9e5 npm packages out there](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Most of which can be accomplished through the use of native JavaScript.

of which only a handful at this time are 

Essentially, every Node package is a JavaScript Library

## Modern JavaScript: SPA Concepts, ES6, State Management

I wouldn't suggest diving right into React or any other view library/framework. There are some core concepts to one should be familiar with before getting lost in the React weeds.

## Getting Into It

### Sand-boxing

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/#) is a great learning environment. I use it on a regular basis. This tool allows you to start messing with different JavaScript technologies in real-time without having to configure a local environment. It also provides a ton of features! Below you'll find links to some of my pens for you to fork then play with.

* [Basic React Component Reference](https://codepen.io/SpeauDetcR/full/VdwEJP) - General overview of a basic React component
* [React and Semantic UI - User Interface](https://codepen.io/SpeauDetcR/full/qYvERm) - This is a code challenge I did about a year ago. All the details are in the pen.
* [React + Redux used to consume API](https://codepen.io/SpeauDetcR/full/ELEozX) - This pen uses the DC Metro open API to check arrival times of upcoming trains

### Generators

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Create Redux App](https://github.com/jonidelv/generator-create-redux-app)

### Demo Apps

So CodePen is primarily used for front-end and API related development. Below you'll find links to some solid Git repositories.

* [Minimalist Real World React App](https://github.com/speaud/SMART-on-FHIR-exercise)
* [Haystack's Developer Exercise](https://github.com/speaud/takehome-exercise)
* [React and Redux Static Pool Game](https://github.com/speaud/o3_pool_app_exercise)

### "Hello World!" Tutorials and Misc. Resources

* [React Based Demo App Collection](https://reactjs.org/community/examples.html)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
* [D3 Gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)

## Haystack's Front-End and API Overview

is this necassary for this exercise..?

path issue avoid npm i -g , if local then call directly ./node_modules/...

## TL;DR

## Preamble

## Setting up your box

## Before messing with JS, I wish I would've been aware of or knew..

[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) similar to CLR

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) similiar to NuGet

Node is a runtime environment!

All of these other libraries and frameworks you hear of or see are dependencies 


libraries and frameworks
